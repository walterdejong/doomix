doomix
======

This program is a (simple) launcher for Linux GZDoom.
Linux GZDoom is not finding my custom WADs, and I don't see any easy way of
loading them. DOOMix allows you to select any WAD and PK3 files using
a file selector, and then you can launch the game. Multiple selections
are possible to combine add-ons.

"It's a gift. Take it. It will give you strength. Help you or your yourney."

I'm sure it will work on other platforms as well (for example FreeBSD,
macOS, and maybe even Windows, but these have not been tested).
If you have GNOME, it is added to the GNOME menu.


Requirements
------------

* python3
* pyQt5
* gzdoom or else
* DOOM.WAD or DOOM2.WAD full release or shareware version
* custom WADs or PK3 files downloaded from the net
